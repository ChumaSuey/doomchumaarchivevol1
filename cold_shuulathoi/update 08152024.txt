DOORTRAKS lines were fixed.

Thanks to my friend Dr.Ferrick and SgtSars (from Slaughterhouse/Nightdive community)
I found out that basically some DOORTRAK textures moved and they were fixed accordingly.

I also playtested the wad on DOOM+DOOM II remaster and it works fine, outside of a slight (i think)
Animation desync with the chaingun with Minicharge weapons... hope this can be fixed or at least doesn't hurt the experience.

End of note.
